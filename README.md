# tweegeemee Transpiler

Code to transpile the Clojure Clisk library code that creates the [tweegeemee](https://twitter.com/tweegeemee) images into other languages.  This will only work for functions that tweegeemee uses and in the format that tweegeemee generates.  The code is a work in progress, *alpha* quality.  And I am vary far from a transpiler expert.  Failures happen quite often.  

The primary benefit of this code is that CUDA and WebGL both use the GPU and it can render tweegeemee images *much* faster than the CPU.  Interactive frame rates are possible.

While images often can be exactly as they are generated by the Clojure Clisk library, there are some exceptions and there is no guarantee of perfect matching.

## Tweegeemee code

Find images via [tweegeemee](https://twitter.com/tweegeemee) and https://tweegeemee.com 

Code for an image can be found in the image detail URL.  For example: 

`curl https://tweegeemee.com/i/220605_013038_C/code > examples/220605_013038_C.clj`

## Languages

### CUDA

The `render_cuda.sh` puts download, transpile and png-creation all in one script.  For example:

`./render_cuda.sh 220605_013038_C`

#### gen_cuda

*gen_cuda* is a program to take the Clojure (clj) code that generates tweegeemee images and transpile it to CUDA.  This cuda code relies on the `cuda/clisk.cuh` library code.

Example:

`./build/src/gen_cuda examples/220605_013038_C.clj > examples/220605_013038_C.cuh`

#### proto 

*proto* is an example program that uses CUDA to generate a PNG file.  It is a simple program
that you could modify for your own use cases.  See the code for various things you can control.

`./build/cuda/proto examples/220605_013038_C.cuh examples/220605_013038_C.png`

Note: If you are not running from the root of this project, use JITIFY_OPTIONS to point to 
where the `cuda` directory is.
